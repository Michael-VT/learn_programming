I found several job postings on glassdoor.com and asked [Grock](https://grok.com/) to help me prepare for the interview. To start, I selected jobs with topics that were of moderate interest to me:
Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Analytics, and related topics.
After that, I decided to start by creating a program for learning the core elements, breaking it down into weeks, with a knowledge assessment at the end of each week, and with no more than four hours of combined theory and practice time each day.
  
Prompt for Grock:
I've compiled a collection of job postings I'd be interested in in the job_collect.txt file. But I'd like to understand what I actually need to know, how to quickly prepare, and what I need to know to land one of these jobs. I'd like to receive recommendations in a compact format. If you need any information about me, it's in the "R&D Engineer CTO Original CV.pdf" file. It doesn't include the last three years, which I spent self-educating myself, slowly learning Python and working with AI systems like Grok, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Perplex, Gmini, Mistral, Cloud, Duck, and others. I also searched for information for the swarm, drew pictures based on prompts, and wrote a small project on a microcontroller running MacOS Sequoia, STM32CubeMX 6.15.0, STM32F411CEU6, and FREERTOS CMSIS V2 MacOS Sequoia. I've applied numerous times and have mostly been rejected, with the explanation that they were lucky to receive many offers and had already found the right candidates. I need some other solution.

I think the plan (3-6 months intensive, 2-4 hours per day) is quite suitable. I need a more detailed plan, with specific details on where and on which websites or how to get lessons (preferably free options if possible, I'm very short on funds). I also need to know what certificates I need to obtain and which ones I should focus on to get a job.
Write a basic outline, broken down by hours and with titles and links to lessons for the first week, estimating up to 4-5 hours per day.
Explain the best way to track progress in GitHub and how to focus on my portfolio in such a short time.
We need to plan the lessons and create a short introduction to understand the outcome. A plan for the first week is recommended, but with a rough outline for the entire course. It would be nice if, at the end of the week, I could answer the surveys I've completed this week so you could create an assessment of my abilities and adjust the entire course for the following week. I think this is very important. So, I'm planning to start classes in four days, having prepared everything for this self-improvement project.
Before that, I want to spend some time on preparatory readings so that I can ease into the process of acquiring a new education.
I have Jupyter installed
> jupyter --version
Selected Jupyter core packages...
IPython: 9.3.0
ipykernel: 6.29.5
ipywidgets: not installed
jupyter_client: 8.6.3
jupyter_core: 5.8.1
jupyter_server: 2.16.0
jupyterlab: 4.4.7
nbclient: 0.10.2
nbconvert: 7.16.6
nbformat: 5.10.4
notebook: not installed
qtconsole: not installed
traitlets: 5.14.3
and I've been working with it for a while now, running simple examples like "Hello World!" I use Jupyter Lab by launching it from the command line and then going to the browser.
