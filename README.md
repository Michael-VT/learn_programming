I found several job postings on glassdoor.com and asked [Grock](https://grok.com/) to help me prepare for the interview. To start, I selected jobs with topics that were of moderate interest to me:
Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Analytics, and related topics.
After that, I decided to start by creating a program for learning the core elements, breaking it down into weeks, with a knowledge assessment at the end of each week, and with no more than four hours of combined theory and practice time each day.
